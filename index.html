          <p>This is an old thought I had a while ago.</p>
          <p>I think cooks should not necessarily be alchemist-healers (see Kirby cook). I think a good cook design
            would be a wizard-warrior full of war wounds with a pyromancer build. This *might* be due to personal
            experience (I am full of war wounds from cooking lol) <img class="tinyimg" src="pics/laugh-0212.gif"
              alt="laughing">
          </p>
          <p>One of my friends told me they have a gnome-thief cook in their campaign. </p>
          <p>It would be fun to see the three cook brothers together.</p>
          <p>Probably it would even be funnier to have a team of just these three cooks: the warrior, the healer and
            the
            thief. Sounds balanced enough.</p>

          <p>A couple of weeks ago, I presented my Bachelor thesis. Given my previous projects, one would expect my
            thesis to be on something like Computer Graphics or Quantum Computing. And I *did* ask the quantum
            computing
            prof to do a thesis on quantum communication or cryptography! But in the end, I did something completely
            different.
          </p>
          <p>My thesis was on <b>free will</b>. <span><img class="tinyimg" src="pics/confused-0116.gif"></span></p>
          <p>Now, if you're curious and want to read what it's all about, head over to <a
              href="https://github.com/cosmcif/bachelor-project" target="_blank">this repo</a>.</p>
          <p>If you want to know how I *really* feel about free will, keep reading.</p>
          <p>Let me just tell you. Pretty much my whole life, I used to think there is no such thing as free will.
            We
            are not free; we are bound by our experiences, emotions, neurons, hormones, and so on. Though I'd
            always admit that humans probably needed to believe in some form of self-determination to not go crazy.
          </p>
          <p> However, after working on this thesis and after reading so much on free will, I'm not saying I
            completely
            changed my mind, but I became obsessed with finding free will <i>somewhere, anywhere, in any amount,
              shape
              and form</i>. I'm no longer happy nor satisfied with the idea that there is no free will at all.</p>
          <p>Whatever William James said: <i>"My first act of free will shall be to believe in free will"</i>.</p>
          <p>Okay that's all for now, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/cosmcif/bachelor-project"
              target="_blank">read my thesis</a> and let me know what you think. There are so many additional
            papers,
            books, articles, and so on you could read on free will, so try not to fall down the rabbit hole!</p>
          <p>Love, Sofia<span><img class="tinyimg" src="pics/flower-0084.gif"></span></p>
          <!-- <p>In conclusion, my foundations have been shaken and I will never be the same again</p> -->
          <!-- <p>I am still of the idea that we need an idea of free agency over our own actions and ideas </p> -->

          <h2>On the strategic withholding of affection. <a class="hlink"
              href="https://cosmcif.github.io/#200723">ðŸ”—</a> <span class="date">July 20th, 2023</span></h2>

          <p>I have seen and heard of many instances of people withholding affection, usually after one or many bad
            experiences with dating or friendship.
          </p>
          <p>Not because they are not capable of giving affection anymore, but because they find comfort in knowing
            that, should this relationship go sour, they didn't "waste" affection for these people, hoping to reduce the
            pain in case the relationship ends.
          </p>
          <p>I believe this is pointless, because the pain of losing a relationship (platonic or romantic) will be the
            same regardless of how much affection you gave.
          </p>
          <p>Some could argue that it isn't true and that the loss of a relationship where you put more effort in hurts
            more than one where you were withholding affection.
          </p>
          <p>To that, I'd respond that usually the "additional" pain doesn't come from the loss of the relationship
            itself but from a feeling of foolishness, the embarrassment of being taken advantage of.
          </p>
          <p>So what I believe is people should give all their affection, without letting the fear of losing them and
            the pain caused by other people influence this.
          </p>
          <p>However, I also believe that one shouldn't empty oneself to give to others. That's when they're taken
            advantage of.
          </p>
          <p>I believe that if you give to others with the pure intention of giving, while enjoying giving and without
            draining yourself, you won't feel that sense of foolishness if the relationship ends.
          </p>
          <p>You'll instead feel that you did the right thing, you did what you were supposed to do, and if things went
            this way, then so be it.
          </p>
          <p>The point is you didn't give because you were trying to get something out of it, but because you purely
            enjoy giving affection for the sake of it.
          </p>
          <p>Of course I'm speaking from my personal experience with friendships and relationships, but it has all led
            me to believe and feel that giving affection of any kind is good and right.
          </p>
          <p>And I found that it gets affection back to you, even though you should be doing it selflessly and for the
            sake of love itself.
          </p>
