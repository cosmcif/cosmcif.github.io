          <h2>Free Will<span class="date">July 11th, 2024</span></h2>
          <p>A couple of weeks ago, I presented my Bachelor thesis. Given my previous projects, one would expect my
            thesis to be on something like Computer Graphics or Quantum Computing. And I *did* ask the quantum computing
            prof to do a thesis on quantum communication or cryptography! But in the end, I did something completely
            different.
          </p>
          <p>My thesis was on <b>free will</b>. <span><img class="tinyimg" src="pics/confused-0116.gif"></span></p>
          <p>Now, if you're curious and want to read what it's all about, head over to <a
              href="https://github.com/cosmcif/bachelor-project" target="_blank">this repo</a>.</p>
          <p>If you want to know how I *really* feel about free will, keep reading.</p>
          <p>Let me just tell you. Pretty much my whole life, I used to think there is no such thing as free will. We
            are not free; we are bound by our experiences, emotions, neurons, hormones, and so on. Though I'd
            always admit that humans probably needed to believe in some form of self-determination to not go crazy.
          </p>
          <p> However, after working on this thesis and after reading so much on free will, I'm not saying I completely
            changed my mind, but I became obsessed with finding free will <i>somewhere, anywhere, in any amount, shape
              and form</i>. I'm no longer happy nor satisfied with the idea that there is no free will at all.</p>
          <p>Whatever William James said: <i>"My first act of free will shall be to believe in free will"</i>.</p>
          <p>Okay that's all for now, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/cosmcif/bachelor-project"
              target="_blank">read my thesis</a> and let me know what you think. There are so many additional papers,
            books, articles, and so on you could read on free will, so try not to fall down the rabbit hole!</p>
          <p>Love, Sofia<span><img class="tinyimg" src="pics/flower-0084.gif"></span></p>
          <!-- <p>In conclusion, my foundations have been shaken and I will never be the same again</p> -->
          <!-- <p>I am still of the idea that we need an idea of free agency over our own actions and ideas </p> -->
          <!-- There are so many things you could read on free will, try not to fall in the rabbit hole!  -->
