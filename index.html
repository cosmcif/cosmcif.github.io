          <p>I think I got a bit dumber. Ever since I stopped reading philosophy-related papers, books and blog posts, I feel a little bit dumber.</p>

          <p>*compared to everyone else's cool coding projects</p>
          <p>Maybe I should get back to reading those things, but I can barely balance studying, work and housework with the tiny shiny time-absorbing screen in my hand.</p>

          <p>I signed up for a piano concert on May 23rd. As a result, lately I've been spending more time playing the piano than on the computer. I missed this. It feels more like me when I'm playing the piano than when I'm coding. Maybe I took the wrong direction in life. I wonder where I'd be now if I went to music school after middle school.</p>

          <p>I realized that, until now, I've been listening to a specific genre of music each month. So here are the first 3 momths of 2025 in music.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><b>January</b>, the month of Iamsu! & bay area rap</li>
            <li><b>February</b>, the month of Sanremo</li>
            <li><b>March</b>, the month of Dave Rodgers & eurobeat</li>

          Let's see if this stays consistent and if I'll keep being obsessed with only one genre at a time lol<img class="tinyimg" src="pics/laugh-0212.gif"

          </h2>
          <p>I think an important thing to learn, particularly for girls, is to simply accept a compliment. You don't
            have to return the compliment, especially if it's just out of politeness.</p>
          <p>A few years ago, I saw a post about learning to accept compliments gracefully, and I took it very
            seriously. Before that, if someone said something nice about me, I felt obligated to say something nice
            back.
            Now, I just say "thank you!" or "that's so sweet of you!" or "you're so kind," instead of saying, "oh,
            you're [compliment] too!". In my opinion, that feels forced.
          </p>
          <p>That doesn't mean you shouldn't compliment people at all. There's a time for everything. I always give
            compliments when someone does something I like, and I'm very vocal about it.

            I simply don't force myself to compliment someone just because they complimented me first. I don't care if
            someone gives compliments just to hear them back - that's not something you should do in the first place.
          </p>
          <p>I also hate fake humility. Just accept my compliment! <span><img class="tinyimg"

          <p>I realize my major sin is envy. I am especially jealous of other people's skills in fields we share, and of
            experiences they had that I haven't. It's somewhat easier to deal with once you're aware of it though. This
            is what I repeat to myself.</p>
          <p>When it comes to skills, it can be a good reason to become better. It is worth to think of what you can be
            in the future, but only if it gives you reason to act in the present. Otherwise, fantasizing about possible
            futures without taking action is counterproductive.</p>
          <p>When it comes to experiences, it is useless to think about what you could have been and what you could have
            done in the past. Of how different you'd be if you grew up in a different environment.</p>
          <p>You wouldn't be where you are if you followed a different life path.</p>
          <p>Are you happy with your current life? To be honest, I am. I have the privilege to study and work abroad,
            travel, make friends, and create good memories. Just in the past year, I've been to Switzerland,
            Liechtenstein, Austria, Finland, France, Spain, and Slovakia. I probably wouldn't have been able to do any
            of this if my past hadn't led me to where I am now.</p>
          <p>So what is it that I'm so jealous of? The stories that others recount. I feel a strange nostalgia for
            memories that don't belong to me. Sometimes I wish I'd had a wilder childhood and teenage years. I wish I'd
            hung out more and done more daring things. I wish I'd done this, and I wish I'd been that.</p>
          <p>But in the end, people like me for who I am now, not for what I could have been.</p>
          <p>They appreciate me as I am, not for what I'm not.</p>
          <p>And at the end of the day, your current, real self is the only one that truly matters.</p>

          <p>When I said I needed a new style for my website, I really meant it. I'm happy with how it looks now, but it
            didn't always look this pretty. You'll understand better by taking a look at my older website iterations.
            I'll leave the links here, and the websites will be accessible for as long as Altervista allows me to keep
            them online.</p>
          <p>My <a href="http://cosmcif.altervista.org/" target="_blank">first website</a> from high school. So extra

          <p>My <a href="http://sofiadatri.altervista.org/" target="_blank">second website</a> from university. I kept
            this template for my first iteration of the github-hosted website, and made a dark mode for it. Sadly I
            don't have any screenshots of it.</p>
          <p>I also had an arcade phase in late 2022 / early 2023 lol!</p>

          <p>This is an old thought I had a while ago.</p>
          <p>I think cooks should not necessarily be alchemist-healers (see Kirby cook). I think a good cook design
            would be a wizard-warrior full of war wounds with a pyromancer build. This *might* be due to personal
            experience (I am full of war wounds from cooking lol) <img class="tinyimg" src="pics/laugh-0212.gif"
              alt="laughing">
          </p>
          <p>One of my friends told me they have a gnome-thief cook in their campaign. </p>
          <p>It would be fun to see the three cook brothers together.</p>
          <p>Probably it would even be funnier to have a team of just these three cooks: the warrior, the healer and
            the
            thief. Sounds balanced enough.</p>

          <p>A couple of weeks ago, I presented my Bachelor thesis. Given my previous projects, one would expect my
            thesis to be on something like Computer Graphics or Quantum Computing. And I *did* ask the quantum
            computing
            prof to do a thesis on quantum communication or cryptography! But in the end, I did something completely
            different.
          </p>
          <p>My thesis was on <b>free will</b>. <span><img class="tinyimg" src="pics/confused-0116.gif"></span></p>
          <p>Now, if you're curious and want to read what it's all about, head over to <a
              href="https://github.com/cosmcif/bachelor-project" target="_blank">this repo</a>.</p>
          <p>If you want to know how I *really* feel about free will, keep reading.</p>
          <p>Let me just tell you. Pretty much my whole life, I used to think there is no such thing as free will.
            We
            are not free; we are bound by our experiences, emotions, neurons, hormones, and so on. Though I'd
            always admit that humans probably needed to believe in some form of self-determination to not go crazy.
          </p>
          <p> However, after working on this thesis and after reading so much on free will, I'm not saying I
            completely
            changed my mind, but I became obsessed with finding free will <i>somewhere, anywhere, in any amount,
              shape
              and form</i>. I'm no longer happy nor satisfied with the idea that there is no free will at all.</p>
          <p>Whatever William James said: <i>"My first act of free will shall be to believe in free will"</i>.</p>
          <p>Okay that's all for now, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/cosmcif/bachelor-project"
              target="_blank">read my thesis</a> and let me know what you think. There are so many additional
            papers,
            books, articles, and so on you could read on free will, so try not to fall down the rabbit hole!</p>
          <p>Love, Sofia<span><img class="tinyimg" src="pics/flower-0084.gif"></span></p>
          <!-- <p>In conclusion, my foundations have been shaken and I will never be the same again</p> -->
          <!-- <p>I am still of the idea that we need an idea of free agency over our own actions and ideas </p> -->

          <h2>On the strategic withholding of affection. <a class="hlink"
              href="https://cosmcif.github.io/#200723">ðŸ”—</a> <span class="date">July 20th, 2023</span></h2>

          <p>I have seen and heard of many instances of people withholding affection, usually after one or many bad
            experiences with dating or friendship.
          </p>
          <p>Not because they are not capable of giving affection anymore, but because they find comfort in knowing
            that, should this relationship go sour, they didn't "waste" affection for these people, hoping to reduce the
            pain in case the relationship ends.
          </p>
          <p>I believe this is pointless, because the pain of losing a relationship (platonic or romantic) will be the
            same regardless of how much affection you gave.
          </p>
          <p>Some could argue that it isn't true and that the loss of a relationship where you put more effort in hurts
            more than one where you were withholding affection.
          </p>
          <p>To that, I'd respond that usually the "additional" pain doesn't come from the loss of the relationship
            itself but from a feeling of foolishness, the embarrassment of being taken advantage of.
          </p>
          <p>So what I believe is people should give all their affection, without letting the fear of losing them and
            the pain caused by other people influence this.
          </p>
          <p>However, I also believe that one shouldn't empty oneself to give to others. That's when they're taken
            advantage of.
          </p>
          <p>I believe that if you give to others with the pure intention of giving, while enjoying giving and without
            draining yourself, you won't feel that sense of foolishness if the relationship ends.
          </p>
          <p>You'll instead feel that you did the right thing, you did what you were supposed to do, and if things went
            this way, then so be it.
          </p>
          <p>The point is you didn't give because you were trying to get something out of it, but because you purely
            enjoy giving affection for the sake of it.
          </p>
          <p>Of course I'm speaking from my personal experience with friendships and relationships, but it has all led
            me to believe and feel that giving affection of any kind is good and right.
          </p>
