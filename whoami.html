                    <p>My favourite colors are pink and green.</p>
                    <p>I like cooking too. Have you checked out my <a

                    <p>I honestly just like the style and vibe.</p>
                    <p>It's like my little personal diary, or the menu you open in a videogame to check out your
                        character's stats, or even the inventory.</p>
                    <p>
                        For this reason, I will add anything I think is important for <b>my own</b> inventory! This is
                        why I have a cookbook section or a graveyard for my dead projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>Similarly, this is also why I don't mind updating it by hand instead of using more efficient or
                        automated methods.
                    </p>
                    <p>If for any reason you'd like a more concise view of my projects, I invite you to take a look at
                        my <a href="https://github.com/cosmcif" target="_blank">GitHub</a> profile.

                    <h3>gamedev</h3>
                    <p>I started from PowerPoint all the way down to Unity. In university, I experimented with games in
                        Racket (bootleg Super Mario), Java (Yu-Gi-Oh type card game) and JavaScript (multiplayer games).
                        Sadly I have a lot of unfinished projects. I might make a graveyard
                        for them on this website.</p>

                    <p>I took piano classes for 3 years when I was 11. After that, I barely played until I
                        turned 20 and bought a new keyboard. Though, I never stopped
                        composing. I learnt to use various software, listed below.</p>
