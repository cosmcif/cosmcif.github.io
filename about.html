                    <p>I'm currently 21. I was born in Italy.</p>
                    <p>I just finished my Bachelor in Informatics at USI in Switzerland.</p>
                    <p>One thing about me, I'll always like too many things at the same time. My main (tech-related)
                        interests are: game development, cryptography / cyber security, quantum computing, computer
                        graphics and composing music. My favourite colors are pink and green.</p>

                    <p>Partially thanks to gamedev, I developed an interest in computer graphics. Have you taken a look
                        at my raytracer? Other than that, I've played around with a lot of digital media software tools,

                        turned 20 and bought a new keyboard. Though, I never stopped
                        composing. I learnt to use various software, listed below.</p>
